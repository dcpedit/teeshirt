* [Size L](https://github.com/dcpedit/teeshirt/tree/master/large-build): standard 60% case (GH60 compatible) build
* Supports 1.5u and 1.25u thumb keys to reduce gap between keycaps
* Spacebars can be 2u or 1.5u for stab-less builds
* Center key can be swapped out for a rotary encoder
* Supports 128x32 OLED display
* Utilizes hot swap sockets
* Uses ProMicro MCU footprint: Elite-C, Nice!Nano, etc.

## Sponsors

The first revision of the PCB was sponsored by PCBWay, so a huge thanks to them for helping get this project off the ground.  Their KiCad plugin made it super easy to send the design directly to their site, where you can place the order and have it shipped out with just a few clicks.
